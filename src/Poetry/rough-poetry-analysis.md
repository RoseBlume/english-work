# Paragraph 1
**Song Title**: "Lucy"
**Artist**: The Divine Comedy
An English band from the UK named after a Poem written by Italian poet "Dante", about Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory. This song deviates from their usual style of music, which is a harder style of rock music that has been modernized to include more electronic elements. This band has been slow to adapt to modern times which has led to a less pollished, almost clumsy integration with technology.
**Release Date**: 18 October 1993
**General Meaning**: This song is about a man who endures many new experiences, for the woman he loves.

# Paragraph 2
**Rhyming Scheme**: This song is written like a quatrain poem in which the first and third lines rhyme, and the second and fourth lines rhyme. This is a common rhyming scheme in poetry and music, and it helps to create a sense of rhythm and flow in the song. **Repitition**: This song, as it is a recollection, it does not make sense to repeat the same section repeatedly.

# Paragraph 3
**Detailed Analysis**: This song draws inspiration from various poems written by William Wordsworth such as "She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways". Interestingly, the song only draws from poems he wrote during the time in which he lived in Germany. This suggests that he was inspired by an actual person who was very culturally different from him.
