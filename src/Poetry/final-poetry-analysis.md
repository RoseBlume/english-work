# Analysis of "Lucy" by The Divine Comedy

"Lucy" by The Divine Comedy is a song that stands out in the band's discography. The Divine Comedy, an English band from the UK, takes its name from a poem by the Italian poet Dante, which delves into themes of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory. Unlike their usual harder rock style, "Lucy" incorporates more electronic elements, marking a departure from their typical sound. The band's slow adaptation to modern times has led to a less polished, almost clumsy integration with technology. Released on 18 October 1993, the song tells the story of a man who undergoes many new experiences for the woman he loves.

The structure of "Lucy" is reminiscent of a quatrain poem, where the first and third lines rhyme, and the second and fourth lines rhyme. This common rhyming scheme in poetry and music helps to create a sense of rhythm and flow. The song, being a recollection, avoids repetition of the same sections, maintaining a narrative flow without redundancy. This approach enhances the storytelling aspect of the song, making it more engaging for the listener.

In a detailed analysis, "Lucy" draws inspiration from various poems by William Wordsworth, particularly "She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways". Interestingly, the song references only the poems Wordsworth wrote during his time in Germany, suggesting that he was inspired by an actual person who was culturally different from him. This connection adds a layer of depth and historical context to the song's narrative, enriching the listener's experience and understanding of the song's themes.
