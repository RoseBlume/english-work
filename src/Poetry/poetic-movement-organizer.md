## Anglo-Saxon 650-1100s
Anglo-Saxon also known as Old English literature, was a movement that spanned from the 650s to the 1100s.

### Defining Characteristics
Anglo-Saxon poetry is characterized by:
- **Alliteration**: The repetition of initial consonant sounds in closely positioned words.
- **Caesura**: A pronounced pause in the middle of a line of poetry, often used to create a rhythmic effect.
- **Kennings**: Compound expressions with metaphorical meanings, e.g., "whale-road" for the sea.
- **Themes of Heroism and Fate**: Focus on heroic deeds, the inevitability of fate, and the transient nature of life.
- **Oral Tradition**: Poems were often passed down orally before being written down, leading to variations in different versions of the same poem.
- **Elegiac Tone**: A sense of mourning and loss, reflecting the harsh realities of life during the Anglo-Saxon period.

### Notable Poets
- Caedmon is by far my favorite poet of this period due to his work on Caedmons Hymn. This poem showcases a pure belief in God and his great miracles.
- Cynewulf is another notable poet from this period. He is known for his religious poems, such as "The Fates of the Apostles" and "Juliana." His works often depict the struggle of Christians in this time period, many of whom were persecuted for their beliefs. The poem "Julianna" is a great example of this, as it tells the story of a Christian martyr who faces persecution for her faith. Some of his poems hint that he is an educated man who understands simple cryptography. Due to his high level of education he was most likely a monk or a priest. As he writes in a Northumbrian, or Mercian style I believe that he lives in the area which is now called the Unitied Kingdom. During this time period Norse Paganism was on the rise in parts of Northumbria and Mercia and there was a lot of violence against Christians which was most likely an inspiration for his poems.
