# Hamlet Tradgedy Checklist

| Concept                        | Explanation |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Elevated Status               | Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark, which gives him a high social status and places him in a position of power and influence. His royal lineage and the expectations placed upon him by society contribute to the gravity of his actions and decisions throughout the play. |
| Medias Res                    | The play begins after the death of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet, with the kingdom already in a state of unrest. This immediate plunge into a troubled scenario sets the stage for the unfolding drama and highlights the existing tensions and conflicts that Hamlet must navigate. |
| Tragic Flaw                   | Hamlet's tragic flaw is his indecisiveness and his obsession with avenging his father's death. His inability to act decisively leads to missed opportunities and ultimately contributes to his downfall. This flaw is a central element of the tragedy, as it drives the plot and leads to the catastrophic consequences that befall him and those around him. |
| Chaos â€“ innocent people die/suffer | Throughout the play, several innocent characters suffer and die as a result of Hamlet's actions and the ensuing chaos. Ophelia, driven to madness by Hamlet's behavior and the death of her father Polonius, drowns. Polonius himself is mistakenly killed by Hamlet. These deaths, among others, illustrate the widespread suffering caused by the tragic events. |
| Hero Dies                     | In the final act, Hamlet is mortally wounded in a duel with Laertes. Despite his efforts to avenge his father's murder, Hamlet's own life is claimed in the process. His death marks the culmination of the tragic arc and underscores the inevitable downfall of the tragic hero. |
| Order is restored             | After the deaths of the main characters, Fortinbras, a Norwegian prince, arrives and takes control of Denmark. His ascension to the throne signifies the restoration of order and stability following the chaos and bloodshed that characterized the play. This resolution is a common feature in tragedies, where the reestablishment of order follows the protagonist's demise. |
